A simple collection of MATLAB functions for evaluating performance in binary classification tasks. Includes most of the greatest hits (accuracy, precision, recall, F1, AUC), along with a few measures that are supposed to be more robust to class imbalance (MCC).

There are also a few functions (with the data_* prefix) that are for partitioning data sets for, e.g., cross validation, etc.
